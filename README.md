## General info
This project, the capstone of MOD 1, is a Command Line Interface Trivia Game. The game allows you to:

- Create a username and password
- Select a topic of trivia to play, along with a level of difficulty
- See your past scores
- Delete your history

The user interacts with this fully through a Command Line Interface (e.g. Terminal in a Mac) by selecting guided options. The questions are sourced from the [Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com/).

## Technologies

This application was written in Ruby. Thus, Ruby is required to be installed on your machine. The application also requires the following [Ruby Gems](https://rubygems.org/) to function:

- [rest-client](https://rubygems.org/gems/rest-client/versions/1.8.0): to communicate the the trivia API. 
- [json](https://rubygems.org/gems/json): To parse incoming data from the trivia API

Further Ruby Gems were used in the development of the application:

- [pry](https://rubygems.org/gems/pry)
- [setup](https://rubygems.org/gems/setup)
- [sinatra](https://rubygems.org/gems/sinatra)
- [bundler](https://rubygems.org/gems/bundler)

### Phase 6: Presentation

It's time to show off your creation to the world! Things you might want to do are:

* Write a README detailing:
  * How to install your application.
  * How to run your application.
  * How to use your application (commands that can be run).
  * What your program looks like (screenshots).
  * etc.
* Prepare a demo video describing how a user would interact with your working project.
    * The video should:
      * Have an overview of your project. (2 minutes max)
* Prepare a presentation to follow your video. (3 minutes max)
    * Your presentation should:
      * Describe something you struggled to build, and show us how you ultimately implemented it in your code.
      * Discuss 3 things you learned in the process of working on this project.
      * Address, if anything, what you would change or add to what you have today?
      * Present any code you would like to highlight.
* Write a blog post about the project and process.
