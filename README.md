## General info
This project, the capstone of MOD 1, is a Command Line Interface Trivia Game. The game allows you to:

- Create a username and password
- Select a topic of trivia to play, along with a level of difficulty
- See your past scores
- Delete your history

The user interacts with this fully through a Command Line Interface (e.g. Terminal in a Mac) by selecting guided options. The questions are sourced from the [Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com/).

---

## Technologies

This application was written in Ruby. Thus, Ruby is required to be installed on your machine. The application also requires the following [Ruby Gems](https://rubygems.org/) to function:

- [rest-client](https://rubygems.org/gems/rest-client/versions/1.8.0): to communicate the the trivia API. 
- [json](https://rubygems.org/gems/json): To parse incoming data from the trivia API
- [text-table](https://rubygems.org/gems/text-table/versions/1.2.4): To make the results of your scores presentable in your terminal
- [rainbow](https://rubygems.org/gems/rainbow): To format the behaiviors (e.g. colors, flashing) of text of certain elements of the game in your terminal
- [bundler](https://rubygems.org/gems/bundler): To help manage dependencies

Further Ruby Gems were used in the development of the application:

- [pry](https://rubygems.org/gems/pry): To help understand what's going on in the application
- [activerecord](https://rubygems.org/gems/activerecord): For the associations of the classes in the backend
- [sqlite3](https://rubygems.org/gems/sqlite3): To build and manage the database
